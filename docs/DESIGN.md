# Design

Settled details. Terse on purpose - this is a working doc.

Subject to the three pillars in the README. A line here that contradicts a
pillar is a bug in this file, not a licence to bend the pillar.

## Setting

Fantasy.

Playable races: human, elf, dwarf, more later. Cosmetic plus one small flavour
perk each. Not a balance lever - a race must never be the correct answer to a
fight.

No character classes.

## Character progression

Skill-by-use. Swing a sword, sword skill grows.

No skill trees, no allocation screens. Your "class" is what you carry and how
you behave, not something picked at character creation.

## Characters and saves

**The character lives in the world, on the host.** One save file holds the
world's edits and every character in it.

Consequence, accepted knowingly: a character cannot leave the world it was made
in. If you are not hosting, your friend cannot play that character, and a new
world means everyone starts over.

The alternative considered and rejected was Valheim's split - character on the
client, world on the host, carried between worlds. Rejected because it requires
the host to trust a client's claims about its own stats, and keeping one
authority for everything is worth more to us than portable characters.

## Combat

Simple and readable. If a player cannot tell what just hit them, it is wrong.

- Light attack, dodge / block.
- Weapon types with distinct feel. Sword, bow, staff first.
- Encounters assume at least two bodies. Tuned for 2, must not go trivial at 4.

## Death

- Downed player can be revived by any teammate.
- Whole party down, or nobody in reach: respawn at the last campfire.
- While dead, the camera follows a living teammate.
- Costs time, not progress.

## Placeable objects

A restricted palette of objects - campfire, torch, marker - placed into the
world. **Not terrain.** Players never place raw voxel blocks.

This is the line that keeps "no base building" true. Give players arbitrary
blocks and someone walls off a cave and calls it home, whether we designed for
it or not. Restricting the palette means there is nothing to build walls from.

Breaking terrain is a separate question and is not settled.

## Mounts

Planned for v0.3+. Speed and flavour, not a combat system.

## Multiplayer

- Host-authoritative. 1 host + up to 3 clients, 4 players maximum.
- Balanced around 2. Solo runs, but is a dev convenience, not a supported mode.
- All players must run the same build.
- ENet now, GodotSteam later behind the existing `NetTransport` interface.

The architecture contract these obey is in the README.
